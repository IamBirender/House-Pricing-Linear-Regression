# House-Pricing-Linear-Regression

We have data of sales of house in some area. For each house we have the complete information about its size, price, number of bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms, whether it is made of bricks, Neighbourhood.

Objective of this case study is to check which factors are effecting house price.

### Expectations

1. Do an exploratory data analysis to identify the initial patterns in this data i.e. identification of outliers, missing values, univariate, and bivariate patterns.
2. Check multicollinearity among independent variables.
3. Use OLS Regression to see price predictors.
4. Does performance check using decile analysis and lift charts.

Description of the variables:
1. Home - Home number (identity)
2. Price - Retail price of home.
3. SqFt - Square feet (area).
4. Bedrooms - Number of Bedrooms 
5. Bathrooms - Number of Bathrooms
